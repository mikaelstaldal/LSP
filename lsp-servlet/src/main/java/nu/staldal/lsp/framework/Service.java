/**
 * Interface for Service.
 *<p>
 * Services will be loaded and instantiated using <code>Class.forName</code> 
 * and <code>Class.newInstance</code>, so they must have a public no-arg 
 * constructor.
 *<p>
 * There will be only one instance of each Service per web application per 
 * JVM (in case of a distributed application). The {@link #execute execute}
 * method may be invoked concurrently by several threads.
 *<p>
 * It's not recommended to have any instance fields in the Service class
 * which can be changed by the {@link #execute execute} method. Instance fields
 * which are initialized by the {@link #init init} method and then only read by
 * the {@link #execute execute} method are OK. If you have instance fields which
 * can be changed by the {@link #execute execute} method, access to them need to be
 * synchronized.
 *<p>
 * The life cycle and instance management of Services are very similar to 
 * {@link javax.servlet.Servlet}, see the Servlet specification for details.
