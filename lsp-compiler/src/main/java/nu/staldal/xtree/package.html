XTree is a lightweight tree representation of an XML document.

<p>XTree is desiged to be compatible with SAX2. An XTree contains (almost)
the same information as a SAX2 {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler}. It's easy
to construct an XTree from SAX2 events using {@link
nu.staldal.xtree.TreeBuilder} and to serialize an XTree into SAX2 events
using the {@link nu.staldal.xtree.Node#toSAX} method.</p>

<p>Unlike DOM, XTree has no concept of a document, a document is equvivalent
to its root element. It's not possible to distinguish between a complete
document and a document fragment, both are simply representated by an {@link
nu.staldal.xtree.Element}.</p>

<p>XTree is deprecated in favor for XMLTree</p>
