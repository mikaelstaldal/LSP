XMLTree is a lightweight tree representation of an XML document.

<p>XMLTree is desiged to be compatible with SAX2. An XMLTree contains (almost)
the same information as a SAX2 {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler}. It's easy
to construct an XMLTree from SAX2 events using {@link
nu.staldal.xmltree.TreeBuilder} and to serialize an XMLTree into SAX2 events
using the {@link nu.staldal.xmltree.Node#toSAX} method.</p>

<p>Unlike DOM, XMLTree has no concept of a document, a document is equvivalent
to its root element. It's not possible to distinguish between a complete
document and a document fragment, both are simply representated by an {@link
nu.staldal.xmltree.Element}.</p>

<p>Qualified names are representated as in {@link javax.xml.namespace.QName#toString}:
"{" + Namespace URI + "}" + local part. If the Namespace URI is empty, 
only the local part is used (no "{" "}").</p>
