/**
 * LSP Extension Library.
 * <p>
 * After instance creation, the init method will be invoked with the 
 * namespace URI. This allows the same class to be used for several
 * namespaces.
 * <p>An LSPExtLib may be reused, but will not be executed concurrently 
 * by several threads. 
 * <p>For each LSP page to process, the startPage method will be invoked 
 * first. Then for each extension element on the LSP page:
 * <ol>
 * <li>beforeElement() is invoked, which returns a ContentHandler "in"
 * <li>the extension element is sent to the ContentHandler "in"
 * 	   (startDocument() and endDocument() will not be invoked).
 * <li>afterElement() is invoked, which may return a String.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * LSP will not use the "in" ContentHandler after invoking the 
 * afterElement() method.
 * <p>
 * The extlib can return data in one of two ways, write to the supplied 
 * ContentHandler "out" (it must not invoke startDocument() or endDocument()), 
 * or return a string from the afterElement() method. It may not do both.
 * <p>
 * For each call to an extension function, a method with the function name
 * prefixed with '_' is invoked. All arguments to this method must be of type
 * Object, and the return type must be Object, it may throw SAXException.
 * Functions may be overloaded based on number of arguments. 
 * <p>
 * After the LSP page is finished, the endPage method is invoked.
 * <p>
 * An easier, but not as flexible, way to implement an extension library is to extend the 
 * {@link nu.staldal.lsp.SimpleExtLib} class.
